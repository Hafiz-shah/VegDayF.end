    <h1 id="idofh1">BENIFITS OF ORAGANIC EATABLES</h1>
    <p id="vegid">
      <br /><br />1. Persistent Pesticides <br /><br />

      Eating organic reduces the amount of chemicals in your diet namely
      persistent pesticides. The use of insecticides, fungicides, fertilizers
      and weedkillers are strictly monitored in organic food production.
      Organic farming produces healthy food without the use of toxic
      pesticides. While some organic farmers do use pesticides they are
      primarily derived from natural substances. These natural pesticides must
      be approved for organic production. The National Organic Standards
      Board, or NOSB, and the National Organic Program, or NOP. maintain a
      list of materials approved for use in organic production. This list is
      determined with input from farmers, business owners, consumer advocates,
      and the public. The general rule for the national list is that naturally
      occurring materials are allowed, and synthetic materials are prohibited,
      however there are some exceptions. Once the NOSB and NOP add a material
      to the national list, third-party organizations like the Organic
      Materials Review Institute evaluate new products to make sure they’re in
      compliance. It’s a process that involves hundreds of technical experts.
      Learn more about this process from the Rodale Institute. The natural
      pesticides that are approved are only allowed to be used when other pest
      control methods aren’t successful. Find out why pesticides can’t just be
      “washed off” here.

      <br /><br />
      2. GMOs <br /><br />

      Eating organic is the best way to avoid GMO foods, ingredients and
      contamination. The use of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. is
      prohibited in organic products. This means an organic farmer can’t plant
      GMO seeds, an organic cow can’t eat GMO alfalfa or corn, and an organic
      soup producer can’t use any GMO ingredients. To meet the USDA organic
      regulations, farmers and processors must show they aren’t using GMOs,
      and that they are protecting their products from contact with prohibited
      substances, such as GMOs, from farm to table. Learn more about why
      choosing organic is the best way to steer clear of GMOs.

      <br /><br />
      3. Health <br /><br />

      No artificial colors, flavors or preservatives are allowed in organic
      food. Cleaner food means cleaner diets which leads to a cleaner bill of
      health. No artificial preservatives, colors or flavors are allowed in
      organic food. Fewer than 40 synthetic substances can be used in organic
      packaged foods, and only after they have been reviewed by independent
      and government experts. By contrast, thousands of chemicals can be added
      to conventional packaged foods, including preservatives, flavors and
      colors linked to health problems. Learn more about these differences in
      organic and conventional foods from EWG. The issues with these
      synthetics additives that are found in processed conventional foods is
      that they are targeted at children and parents. These chemically
      addictive additives lead to many health problems. The hidden cost in
      this “cheap” food is the fees American’s are paying with their health.
      From diabetes to obesity, to ADHD, the food-related diseases are at an
      all-time high. As the New York Times recently put it, “Our Food Is
      Killing Us.”

      <br />
      <br />4. Soil Health <br /><br />

      Organic farming creates healthy soil. Healthy soil creates healthy food
      and a healthy environment. Healthy soil is the basis for organic
      agriculture. Organic farmers use natural organic fertilizers and soil
      amendments like organic matter (things you can compost), green manures
      (cover crops grown specifically for soil improvement, e.g. legumes), and
      animal manures (with safety restrictions) to build healthy soil. When
      food is grown in healthy soil, crops are better able to resist disease,
      survive drought, and tolerate insects. Learn more about building soil
      fertility on an organic farm in the USDA’s Guide for Organic Crop
      Producers.

      <br /><br />
      5. Nutrition <br /><br />

      Organic food contains more vitamins, minerals, enzymes and
      micronutrients than conventionally raised food. There is a growing body
      of evidence documenting how farming methods can influence the
      nutritional content of foods. A six-year study found more antioxidant
      activity and higher flavonol content in organic onions over
      conventional. Meta-analysis published 2016 in the British Journal of
      Nutrition, found that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent
      more omega-3 fatty acids. increase is the result of animals foraging on
      grasses rich in omega-3s, which then end up in dairy and meats. An
      18-month milk study in 2013 found that organic production enhances milk
      nutritional quality by shifting fatty acid composition. Meta-analysis
      published in 2014, in the British Journal of Nutrition, found that
      organic crops had significantly higher antioxidants than conventional
      crops, including 19% higher levels of phenolic acids, 69% higher levels
      of flavanones, 28% higher levels of stilbenes, 26% higher levels of
      flavones, 50% higher levels of flavonols, and 51% higher levels of
      anthocyanines. A ten year comparison study of tomatoes conducted in
      2008, at the University of California, Davis, found that organic
      tomatoes have almost double the concentration of a beneficial flavonoid
      known as quercetin, compared with conventional tomatoes grown on an
      adjacent field. In a 2001 study published in The Journal of Alternative
      and Complementary Medicine, they look at already published literature to
      compare the nutrient content in five common organic vegetables versus
      “conventionally” grown ones. In organic carrots, spinach, lettuce,
      potato and cabbage there was significantly more Vitamin C, Iron,
      Magnesium and Phosphorus and less nitrates than the alternatively grown
      ones. A 2019 study on dairy products had findings showing antibiotics
      were detected in 60% of conventional milk samples whereas organic
      samples did not contain antibiotics. By testing milk straight off store
      shelves, researchers were able to uncover exactly what consumers are
      ingesting when they choose conventional or organic milk.
      <br />
      <br />6. Food Future <br /><br />

      Eat organic because supply meets demand. As consumers we have three
      votes per day for our food future. This puts us in a powerful position
      to design the $1 trillion food industry market in America. Spending
      dollars in the organic sector is a direct vote for a sustainable future
      for the many generations to come. Although organic is the largest
      growing sector in the food industry, it still only accounts for around
      5% of purchases. The more consumers demand organic, the more readily it
      will be made available in larger supply. Large grocery outlets like
      Costco and Wal-Mart carry organic food but so do small Co-Ops and corner
      stores. Costco passed $4 billion in annual sales from organic produce in
      2016, eclipsing Whole Foods for the title of organic heavyweight
      champion in the U.S. Organic farmers couldn’t grow produce fast enough
      to supply the retailer so they decided to lend money to farmers to buy
      land and equipment to grow more organic produce. If the organic industry
      continues to grow, more opportunities, like the one Costco provides to
      farmers, will be available to people looking to move into the organic
      space.

      <br /><br />
      7. Sewage Sludge <br /><br />

      Organic farming never uses sewage sludge. Sewage sludge is a product of
      wastewater treatment and contains numerous known and unknown hazardous
      materials – including everything that is flushed into the sewer system.
      Once treated, sewage sludge can be applied to agricultural cropland as
      fertilizer – meaning, this chemical soup that is often full of toxic
      compounds, nanomaterial, hormones and dangerous pathogens, are applied
      to the very food we eat. But not on organic food! Organic products are
      managed according to defined processes for planting, growing, raising
      and handling. A very important part of the process-based regulatory
      framework is the prohibition of certain methods in organic production
      and handling. Methods like irradiation, sewage sludge, and genetic
      engineering are all expressly prohibited from being used when growing or
      processing organic foods.

      <br />
      <br />8. Irradiation <br /><br />

      Organic food is never irradiated. Irradiated food is exposed to an
      intense ionizing radiation. This is done in a processing room for a
      specified duration. With food irradiation, radiant energy (electrons,
      gamma rays or x-rays) breaks chemical bonds and the intention is to
      reduce microorganisms. The concern is that radiation is known to cause
      cancer. Irradiated food does not meet the U.S. Department of
      Agriculture’s definition of organic. The USDA works with the FDA to
      incorporate food irradiation where it is appropriate. The USDA also
      controls the use of the word “organic” on food labels. Foods that have
      been irradiated, no matter how they are grown or produced, cannot be
      labeled as a USDA certified organic product.

      <br /><br />
      9. Climate Change <br /><br />

      Organic farming supports carbon sequestration, which helps to mitigate
      rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The primary benefit of organic
      crop and livestock production, compared to conventional agriculture, is
      that it is focused on soil-based production with underlying principles
      of maintaining or improving soil quality. Healthy soil counteracts
      climate change by pulling carbon out of the atmosphere. This is similar
      to how native ecosystems, including prairies and forests, act as carbon
      sinks in nature. Recent data from farming systems and pasture trials
      around the globe show that we could sequester more than 100% of current
      annual CO2 emissions with a switch to regenerative organic agriculture
      practices. Take a deeper dive into carbon sequestration and climate
      change-related news stories and studies below. How Organics Fight

      Revolution Could Reverse Climate Change
      <br /><br />
      10. Pollinators <br /><br />

      Organic farms and crops are pollinator-friendly and protect bees,
      pollinators and wildlife from toxic chemicals. The Organic Center
      released a report showing that organic farming has an important role to
      play in supporting the health of our pollinators. Large-scale,
      chemically intensive agricultural production has been implicated as a
      major source of threats to pollinators. Increasingly, scientific
      research demonstrates that the use of toxic synthetic pesticides,
      destruction of native habitat, and a decrease in nutritious forage due
      to extensive use of mono-cropping are detrimental to pollinators. A
      number of studies reviewed in this report have demonstrated that organic
      farming practices alleviate many threats to honey bees and that organic
      farms support significantly more pollinators than conventional farms.
      This is because organic farming standards not only prohibit the use of
      synthetic pesticides, many of which are highly toxic to bees and can be
      persistent in the environment but also require that organic producers
      manage their farms in a manner that fosters biodiversity and improves
      natural resources.

      <br /><br />
      11. Farmworkers <br /><br />

      Organic farming doesn’t expose neighboring communities and farmworkers
      to dangerous persistent pesticides. Farmworkers are at great risk for
      exposure to agricultural pesticides and the adverse health impacts that
      can occur as a result. Neighbors are also at risk for exposure through
      pesticide drift if they lizve near a big farm or a conventionally
      managed park or playing field. Pesticide drift is a threat to human
      health as well as to wildlife and ecosystems. In 2018, the Organic
      Center released a report that details the impacts of the conventional
      use of synthetic pesticides on farmer and farmworker health – and how
      organic can be used as a model to decrease the exposure of this
      important part of our society. A recent study published in Environmental
      Research adds evidence to a larger body of research showing that eating
      organic very well may reduce pesticides in the human body. The study
      found that families eating a 100 percent organic diet rapidly and
      dramatically reduced their exposure to four classes of pesticides—by an
      average of 60 percent—over six days.

      <br /><br />
      12. Environment <br /><br />

      Support a healthy environment for all of us by choosing organic food.
      Organic farming practices result in numerous environmental benefits.
      Organic farming rebuilds soil health and stops harmful chemicals from
      getting into our water supplies. Water and soil are two extremely
      important resources necessary for growing food. Organic farmers don’t
      rely on non-renewable oil-based fertilizers and pesticides we may not
      always have access to. Organic farming results in greater biodiversity.
      Organic farming releases fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
      <br /><br />
      13. Contamination <br /><br />

      GMO contamination is a reality, but you have the power to reject GMOs by
      choosing organic. Recently in 2019, farmers in France and Germany were
      digging up thousands of hectares of rapeseed fields after traces of
      genetically engineered crops (GMOs) banned for cultivation were found in
      seeds sold by Bayer. In the same year, the USDA confirmed the discovery
      of unapproved, genetically engineered wheat plants growing in an
      agricultural field in Washington State. The Center for Food Safety has
      documented a few other episodes in which pollen or seeds from
      genetically engineered crops have contaminated conventional crops, often
      causing seed or product recalls, and other problems for farmers and
      consumers. The use of GMOs is prohibited in organic products.

      <br /><br />
      14. Water <br /><br />

      Choosing organic protects the streams and lakes downstream from toxic
      runoff that conventional farming produces. Many byproducts of
      conventional farming threaten watersheds and pollute drinking water.
      Runoff from farms carries soil and farm inputs-like fertilizer and
      pesticides- into nearby creeks and streams. Excess nitrogen and
      phosphorous that has leeched into the water causes an overgrowth of
      algae in a short period of time (algae blooms). The overgrowth of algae
      consumes oxygen and blocks sunlight from underwater plants. The lack of
      oxygen makes it impossible for aquatic life to survive, creating dead
      zones. The largest dead zone is in the Gulf of Mexico and occurs every
      summer as a result of nutrient pollution from farms leeching and running
      down through the Mississippi River. Organic farmers, like any others,
      need to provide nitrogen and phosphorus for crops grow. But unlike
      conventional farmers, organic farmers rarely rely primarily on chemical
      fertilizers, which would be costly and inconsistent with the organic
      approach to soil fertility. Organic farmers use natural organic
      fertilizers and soil amendments like organic matter, green manures, and
      animal manures to build healthy soil. The use of organic soil amendments
      rather than synthetic fertilizers provides crops with complex nutrient
      sources that are slow to release and limit their loss into the soil and
      into our waters. Other solutions to curbing farm runoff include the use
      of buffer zones, removing the use or need for synthetic inputs, and
      creating healthy soil. Cover cropping helps prevent soils from washing
      away, and help recycle nutrients; crop rotations prevent nutrient
      stripping from the soil; and the composting of plant and animal
      materials, and the use of manure as fertilizer results in higher rates
      of nitrogen recycling reducing the introduction of new nitrogen
      pollution to the environment. All of these practices are already common
      strategies in organic agriculture. Crop rotations also prevent nutrient
      stripping from the soil.

      15. Cancer <br /><br />

      Eating organic can reduce your risk of cancer. A new study in JAMA
      Internal Medicine found that those who ate organic foods frequently
      lowered their overall risk of developing cancer. Specifically, those who
      primarily eat organic foods were more likely to ward off non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma and postmenopausal breast cancer compared to those who rarely
      or never ate organic foods.
